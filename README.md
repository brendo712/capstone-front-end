#Vanlife Travel

## Link to App
not currently working on heroku


##Pitch

My idea is for an app that will allow users to build out itineraries specific to traveling in a van/camper. I want the user to be able to build a profile which will allow them to create itineraries, update them for any unplanned changes, look back on them and leave reviews of their experience, and share them with their friends.

## Technologies

Python/flask
React
semantic-ui
peewee
sqlite

## User Stories

Users are people who want a place to plan and document their travels and be able to share them with their friends

## Unsolved problems

- Google maps API: I was able to get it to work on test basis but i just couldn't decide on what i wanted to do with it.
- relationships: I set up the models but couldn't figure out the functions that would allow this to work the way i wanted it to.
- trip data: I had set up different models with foreign keys so that i could relate them all and add them individually but doing that on the front end turned out to be a problem for me.
- I would also like to add a part to the profile that really get into the gear of it all. I am fascinated by peoples van conversions and would love to do one of my own one day.
